## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.12 or higher

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/valuecell.git
   cd valuecell
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

# From project root
bash start.sh  # Linux/macOS
# or
.\start.ps1    # Windows
```

### Frontend Development

## Code Style

### Python

We use **Ruff** for linting and formatting, and **isort** for import sorting.

**Run formatting:**

```bash
make format
```

**Run linting:**

```bash
make lint
```

### Frontend

We use **Biome** for linting and formatting.

**Run checks:**

```bash
cd frontend
bun run check:fix  # Auto-fix all issues
```

**Key style rules:**

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Maintain component modularity
